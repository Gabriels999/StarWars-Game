# StarWars-Game

Project created for a selective process presenting a Star Wars game. The game works by turns and has it own rules explained, in addition, it has a fun video made by me to help recreate the Star Wars universe. Project created using HMTL5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP. Hope you like it, I had so much fun making this game; always having more and more ideias to implement.

Here's the link to play the game: https://gabriels999.github.io/StarWars-Game/
